# Search-Flights
A GUI program where users can search for available flights, view details and complete the booking on the third party site. 

This application was developed using the classes, widgets and components contained within the Tkinter Python package, in addition to multiple standard Python libraries. 

### Not currently deployed to a public server, but it can be accessed by downloading the project files and running main.py, and it will require an APIKEY for the Tequila Search API, which can be obtained from https://tequila.kiwi.com/ (requires a registered account). The obtained key should be assigned to variable: tequila_APIKEY, in flight_search.py
